    (13,5,'Undergraduate study at Yale is incredibly rewarding. The residential college system gives a much healthier environment than one would expect from a competitive school. Each college has its own resources for students, on top of the many other resources available ranging from career guidance to mental health and counselling.','001426'),
    (14,3,'There are outstanding professors and library resources at Yale; however, admission into classes and even extracurricular groups get fiercely competitive. Also, although Yale is trying to brand itself as more of a STEM school these days, it is still sorely lacking in many STEM areas, with insufficient faculty and limited class offerings.','001426'),
    (15,1,'Greek life isn''t very big. There''s not really a point to being in a frat/sorority here','001426'),
    (16,5,'Its been a really great program. Great resources. The campus is beautiful tooo! The campus is big so u need a bike.','001305'),
    (17,3,'One of my instructors was great, I love his class. The other professor wasn''t as good. I wasn''t able to keep up in his class and there weren''t many online resources for struggling students','001305'),
    (18,1,'The campus police are not very strict. If you''re a good kid and you don''t drink or do drugs you should be fine but if you do it''s not that often that you''ll be severely punished.','001305'),
    (19,5,'UChicago is definitely hard, but well worth the work! You get to learn from great professors and are surrounded by very smart people','001774'),
    (20,3,'Everyone seems very driven, but this allows for a hyper-competitive environment. Because writing and core fundamentals are stressed in the education experience at this school, most students are eloquent speakers and great writers.','001774'),
    (21,1,'The Greeks throw mediocre parties full of sad and resentful people. No one likes or appreciates them otherwise. If they were to suddenly vanish, some underground student organization would definitely step up to continue Wednesday Bar Night.','001774'),
    (22,5,'The University of Pennsylvania has been a great undergraduate experience for me. Transferring in, I immediately found the community I was looking for.','003378'),
    (23,3,'Some of the professors were not very helpful when it came to learning online. However, the school itself and many other professors were very helpful.','003378'),
    (24,1,'Worst experience of my life. Came in as an injured athlete, received no help whatsoever when I wasn''t mobile. I have autism, and they did no accommodations for me. I had to leave due to the issues I endured, going to a new school in the fall. Whatever you do, don''t waste 80k on this school: it isn''t worth it.','003378'),
    (25,5,'Great academic and research environment. Amazing people all around, from students to faculty. Only problem is the administration.','001131'),
    (26,3,'A few houses have just casual parties; there are also the 8 interhouse parties which are really great / tons and tons of work. Literally preparing for the party for more than 1 month ahead of time, with hundreds of manhours.','001131'),
    (27,1,'Not Much Support – Students are generally too busy and uninterested to come to sporting events, and a perpetually losing team doesn''t help. About 5 or 10 people show up for most home sporting events.','001131'),
    (28,5,'It is a pretty big school with a beautiful campus, skilled professors, and a strong campus culture. I enjoyed my time here, but the city of Durham is rather small.','002920'),
    (29,3,'Social life is very niche and cliquey, campus is nice and the food is good, school reputation does make a difference when job hunting.','002920'),
    (30,1,'It doesn''t tastes good. at all. They all taste like paper. By the end of the year, I seldom use my food points as I spent most of my time eating off-campus.','002920'),
    (31,5,'Really cooperative environment and pretty campus. There are a lot of facilities and staff that make life a lot more helpful and enjoyable.','E00473'),
    (32,3,'Very intellectual academic institution that unfortunately does not pay enough attention to its departments in the humanities and social sciences. The latter are becoming more and more quantitative. Also for from the most moral of administrative teams.','E00473'),
    (33,1,'If you''re pre-med, do not come here. Go to another school where you can get a higher GPA and be able to do more extracurriculars. It''s honestly not worth it.','E00473'),
    (34,5,'My time at Northwestern has been great -- I can''t think of any other school that would give me so much freedom to explore different subjects and classes until I find what''s right for me. While academics are certainly rigorous, I haven''t felt that it''s unmanageable, and I can maintain a good work-life balance.','001739'),
    (35,3,'Northwestern is a decent university, mostly because of the staff and faculty who actually care about students. Admin care more about their wallets than the well being of their students and staff.','001739'),
    (36,1,'Absolutely inhumane response to Covid. Students locked up alone for 10 days plus. Zero regard for our mental health. The administrators do not care about the students. Lucky to have good friends to get through this time. A lot of students are really struggling.','001739'),
    (37,5,'The best undergraduate education in the country. Dartmouth professors really care about their students. Amazingly talented and well-rounded student body. Very collaborative environment. Alumni loyalty and network is unparalleled.','002573'),
    (38,3,'During the weekends when students throw or are going to parties or little get togethers sometimes it gets out of hand. The places I feel uncomfortable around is frat row.','002573'),
    (39,1,'Greek life is the most controversial thing on campus. There''s a ton of debate about sexual assault, binge drinking, and lack of inclusivity (fancy words meaning creating elitist areas), and such. It''s pretty revealing that these problems are always discussed with Greek institutions to show how pervasive the problem is.','002573'),
    (40,5,'Some of the nicest and most helpful people I have ever met attend Brown. Everyone wants one another to succeed, and this includes classmates, professors, friends, etc.','003401'),
    (41,3,'Online learning was pretty messy, but given that professors had minimal time to prepare for it, I would say they created an effective grading system and adjusted their expectations appropriately.','003401'),
    (42,1,'Brown University offers a great education, but unfortunately, they do not seem to sincerely care about their students. I had a terrible roommate situation, and the deans did nothing to help me.','003401'),
    (43,5,'Best College ever I love baseball and Football and I love sports so it was the best college for anybody that likes sports. Also the campus is really big and people are really nice','003535'),
    (44,3,'The education is excellent, professors dedicated. The diversity is nonexistent, at least when I attended. There are different ethnic groups on campus but not a lot of interaction between them. The school''s attention to the arts is lacking.....you can continue to learn your craft more as a hobby here or through your own hard work throughout the city. However, the broad range of access to information here is incredible, and there are a lot of opportunities to push yourself and strive academically. There are pretty much no limits to that.','003535'),
    (45,1,'I don''t know if Vanderbilt has Greek life that''s truly worse than most other schools with Greek life, but I honestly hate it. The sheer amount of clique-y-ness that goes on sororities is immature enough, but the partying, underage drinking, and repeated sexual assault cover-ups that happen in the frats is so below the character and the reputation of this school.','003535'),
    (46,5,'The overall academics and great balance of student life they offer is amazing. There''s a lot of flexibility within a student''s schedule itself.','002520'),
    (47,3,'More diversity of professors and faculty in general. Fossil fuel divestment. The Chancellor prioritizes money over anything else.','002520'),
    (48,1,'The permit costs are outrageous ($500+ per year). Not only does Washington University fail to admit students who are from lower socioeconomic statuses, but also make going to school there very difficult for those who do get in because of the huge extra costs of attendance - such as mandating freshman to live on campus in dorms that cost $14,000+ per year.','002520'),
    (49,5,'Cornell has been my dream school since I entered high school. To be honest, it is everything I ever wanted and more :)','002711'),
    (50,3,'Some courses are well-designed and easy to understand. It mainly depends on the professors. The recorded version of lectures are helpful to me to review contents.','002711'),
    (51,1,'This is not a safe campus. I have zero idea how anyone can ignore this fact or say otherwise in good conscience. The professors are okay if they don''t decide to cop major attitudes. The students I could mostly live without. They''re generally so competitive it''s sickening and entirely counterproductive and unacademic. I both attended and taught at this university and I definitely wouldn''t recommend it although it has some positive things to offer if you can get around the safety issues and unbelievably toxic attitudes.','002711'),
    (52,5,'I love the atmosphere and the diverse student body. The sense of family is strong here. The campus is beautiful and offers a sense of home.','003604'),
    (53,3,'Rice is an excellent school. The sport management major is a bit over-hyped because at the end of the day the faculty don’t have enough connections to help sport management students get jobs or internships. When the tough get going (Covid) the going must get tough and that is not happening at Rice’s sport management department.','003604'),
    (54,1,'My experience at Rice was both good and bad. Rice has some amazing people, however, they are very poor at having unique ideas. The University follows the same mindset and it is assumed everyone thinks the same. Sadly if you disagree with the majority you get placed out and feel very unwelcomed.','003604'),
    (55,5,'Notre Dame is an excellent community. The professors genuinely care about their students, the dorm communities are fantastic, and there is always something to do. The campus is also beautiful.','001840'),
    (56,3,'Don’t come here if you want to party. Seriously. It’s got a beautiful campus, good teachers, great class sizes and prestige but such a terrible social scene.','001840'),
    (57,1,'The strictness in regards to underage drinking is completely lopsided. Male students are rarely punished for infractions, while female students are humiliated and punished severely. Visitation requires students to leave opposite-sex dorms are certain times, which fosters skewed gender relations.','001840'),
    (58,5,'I’m a student and major in Biology. I want to be a forensic scientist in criminology and for now, I think that I have well started thanks to UCLA, I learned so many things !','001315'),
    (59,3,'It is a great school with a lot of resources. A lot of opportunities for research. Since it is just a big school, it can be quite tough to navigate.','001315'),
    (60, 1, 'UCLA does not care about the wellbeing of its students. All of the professors are there just to do research and suck a teaching. I want a refund.', '001315');
